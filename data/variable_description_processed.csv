10m u-component of wind;u10;m s-1;;Eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. This variable can be combined with the V component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.;False;;;;
10m v-component of wind;v10;m s-1;;Northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. This variable can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.;False;;;;
2m dewpoint temperature;d2m;C;;Temperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur.It is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (째C) by subtracting 273.15.;False;;;;
2m temperature;t2m;C; Temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or in-land waters.;Temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or in-land waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (째C) by subtracting 273.15.;False;7.0;17.0;-1.5;3.0
Evaporation from bare soil;evabs;m of water equivalent;;The amount of evaporation from bare soil at the top of the land surface. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.;True;;;;
Evaporation from the top of canopy;evatc;m of water equivalent;;The amount of evaporation from the canopy interception reservoir at the top of the canopy. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.;False;;;;
Evaporation from vegetation transpiration;evavt;m of water equivalent;;Amount of evaporation from vegetation transpiration. This has the same meaning as root extraction i.e. the amount of water extracted from the different soil layers. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.;True;;;;
Leaf area index high vegetation;lai_hv;m2 m-2;;One-half of the total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for high vegetation type.;False;;;;
Leaf area index low vegetation;lai_lv;m2 m-2;;One-half of the total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for low vegetation type.;False;;;;
Skin reservoir content;src;m of water equivalent;;Amount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a thin layer on the soil. It represents the amount of rain intercepted by foliage, and water from dew. The maximum amount of 'skin reservoir content' a grid box can hold depends on the type of vegetation, and may be zero. Water leaves the 'skin reservoir' by evaporation.;True;;;;
Skin temperature;skt;C;;Temperature of the surface of the Earth. The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (째C) by subtracting 273.15.;False;;;;
Snow cover;snowc;%;;It represents the fraction (0-1) of the cell / grid-box occupied by snow (similar to the cloud cover fields of ERA5);False;;;;
Snowfall;sf;m of water equivalent;Accumulated total snow that has fallen to the Earth's surface.;Accumulated total snow that has fallen to the Earth's surface. It consists of snow due to the large-scale atmospheric flow (horizontal scales greater than around a few hundred metres) and convection where smaller scale areas (around 5km to a few hundred kilometres) of warm air rise. If snow has melted during the period over which this variable was accumulated, then it will be higher than the snow depth. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units given measure the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step.;True;;;;
Soil temperature level 1;stl1;C;Temperature of the soil in layer 1 (0 - 7 cm).;Temperature of the soil in layer 1 (0 - 7 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. The surface is at 0 cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (째C) by subtracting 273.15.;False;;;;
Soil temperature level 2;stl2;C;;Temperature of the soil in layer 2 (7 -28cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.;False;;;;
Soil temperature level 3;stl3;C;;Temperature of the soil in layer 3 (28-100cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.;False;;;;
Soil temperature level 4;stl4;C;Temperature of the soil in layer 1 (0 - 7 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. The surface is at 0 cm.;Temperature of the soil in layer 4 (100-289 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System;False;;;;
Sub-surface runoff;ssr;m;;Some water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.;False;;;;
Surface net thermal radiation;str;J m-2;;Net thermal radiation at the surface. Accumulated field from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. By model convention downward fluxes are positive;True;;;;
Surface pressure;sp;Pa;;Pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere on the surface of land, sea and in-land water. It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above the area of the Earth's surface represented at a fixed point. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this variable are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).;False;;;;
Surface solar radiation downwards;ssrd;J m-2;Amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth. This variable comprises both direct and diffuse solar radiation. ;Amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth. This variable comprises both direct and diffuse solar radiation. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface (represented by this variable). To a reasonably good approximation, this variable is the model equivalent of what would be measured by a pyranometer (an instrument used for measuring solar radiation) at the surface. However, care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.;True;3500000000.0;6200000000.0;;
Surface thermal radiation downwards;strd;J m-2;;Amount of thermal (also known as longwave or terrestrial) radiation emitted by the atmosphere and clouds that reaches the Earth's surface. The surface of the Earth emits thermal radiation, some of which is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. The atmosphere and clouds likewise emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface (represented by this variable). This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.;True;;;;
Total evaporation;e;m of water equivalent;Accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above.;Accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast to the end of the forecast step. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.;False;;;;
Total precipitation;tp;m;Accumulated liquid and frozen water, including rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. Accumulated liquid and frozen water, including rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. ;Accumulated liquid and frozen water, including rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale precipitation (that precipitation which is generated by large-scale weather patterns, such as troughs and cold fronts) and convective precipitation (generated by convection which occurs when air at lower levels in the atmosphere is warmer and less dense than the air above, so it rises). Precipitation variables do not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at the surface of the Earth. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of precipitation are depth in metres. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step.;True;0.3;2.0;-0.5;0.5

The surface is at 0 cm. The volumetric soil water is associated with the soil texture (or classification), soil depth, and the underlying groundwater level.;False;0.15;0.5;;
